% Cute description here
``Art thou good at these \emph{kickshawses}!” wrote Shakespeare, a slang term from him for something frivolously fancy and fun. These slippers will be a fun project, and make you feel fancy during the colder seasons, but they are certainly not frivolous! Warm and practical, the three-part construction allows you to custom-fit the slippers. \vspace{-1em}

Join MC to work with both MC and CC in stripes. Repeat Rows 7-10 a total of 1 (4, 7, 10) times \adjustment{or until you are roughly at the halfway point of Part 1’s sole.} For a tighter fit at the ankle, work one or two extra repeats. When switching between colors, leave old color in front of RS, and pick up the new color from the left, twisting the two yarns.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% APPENDICES (IF ANY)
\section*{Modification Suggestions}

\subsection*{High Arch/Instep Shaping}

\emph{This modification is shown in the yellow sample.} To add more room in the instep for high arches or deep heels, you can increase in Part 2 and then decrease in Part 3.

\subsubsection*{Part 2 Increases}

About an inch/2.5cm before the halfway point of Part 1's sole, begin increasing by replacing Rows 8 and 10 with the MC and CC Increase Rows, respectively. 

\rowDir{MC Increase Row (WS, MC)} Sl1 wyif, p to 2 sts from end, kfb, k1.

\rowDir{CC Increase Row (WS, CC)} Sl1 wyif, k to 2 sts from end, kfb, k1.

\subsubsection*{Part 3 Decreases}

\rowDir{MC Decrease Row (WS, MC)} Sl1 wyif, p to 3 sts from end, p2tog, sl1 wyif, pick up and purl 1 st in selvedge (selvedge st will be CC), psso.

\rowDir{CC Decrease row (WS, CC)} Sl1 wyif, k to 3 sts from end, k2tog, sl1 wyif, pick up and purl 1 st in selvedge (selvedge st will be MC), psso.

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.3\linewidth}
\vspace{2em}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./photos/smallVersions/yellow_shapedheel.png}
\vspace{-4em}
\end{wrapfigure} \leavevmode

\subsection*{Heel Shaping}

\emph{This modification is shown in the yellow sample.} If your CC yarn is a superwash wool or other fiber that is not as bouncy as regular wool, the garter stitch heel may be prone to growing and falling down. Shaping the heel can bring up the back seam and reduce the stretchiness of the heel fabric.

~\\
In Part 2, in the first 3 (5, 6, 8) repeats of Rows 9 and 10, replace Row 9 with the Heel Decrease Row. Work Rows 9 and 10 as written 2 (3, 4, 6) more times. In the last 3 (5, 6, 8) repeats of Rows 9 and 10, replace Row 9 with the Heel Increase Row.

\rowDir{Heel Decrease Row (RS, CC)} Sl1 wyif, k to 3 sts from end, k2tog, sl1 wyib, pick up and knit 1 st in selvedge, psso.

\rowDir{Heel Increase Row (RS, CC)} Sl1 wyif, k to 2 sts from end, kfb, sl1 wyib, pick up and knit 1 st in selvedge, psso.

Alternatively (or in addition to this shaping), you can also substitute the garter stitch for a less elastic stitch, such as eye of partridge or half-linen stitch.

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.3\linewidth}
\vspace{1em}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./photos/smallVersions/black_foldedcuff.png}
\vspace{-4em}
\end{wrapfigure} \leavevmode

\subsection*{Folded Cuff}

\emph{This modification is shown in the black sample.} Folding the cuff into the inside of the slipper not only changes the silhouette, but can also provide padding at the heel. Because the doubled fabric is also thicker and less elastic than the unfolded fabric, this modification might also help the slipper stay up.

~\\
After closing the toe, turn the slipper inside out and fold the back of the cuff so that the top edge meets the heel seam. Whipstitch the cuff edge to the middle of the heel's inside. The cuff should be secure even with just a few stitches.

\subsection*{Custom Sizing}

Making a custom size will start with creating a sole of the correct size and shape in Part 1. Perhaps you are creating a larger size than written for felting, or using a different gauge. These instructions assume that you know your desired foot width and foot length. You will also need your gauge in both stockinette and garter.

\begin{flushleft} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\linewidth} p{0.75\linewidth}}

\textbf{\mbox{1. Sole stitch} count: \blank} & Determine the full sole stitch count by dividing the desired foot width by your stitch gauge. \\
\textbf{\mbox{2. Sole CO count:} \blank} & Divide the sole stitch count by 3 (round up to nearest whole number). Make sure the difference between the sole stitch count and sole CO count is \emph{even}. \\
\textbf{\mbox{3. \# repeats of} \mbox{Row 1 and Row 4: \blank}} &  Subtract the sole CO count from the sole stitch count. \\
\textbf{\mbox{4. Wedge length:} \blank} & Get the length of the increase/decrease wedge pieces by dividing \#3 by your garter row gauge. \\
\textbf{\mbox{5. \# repeats of} \mbox{Rows 2 \& 3: \blank}} & Subtract two times \#4 from the desired foot length. Divide this result by your stockinette row gauge, and round up to the nearest odd number.
