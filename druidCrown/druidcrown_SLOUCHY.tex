The leaf-inspired colorwork on this hat evokes the druid's primal magics, drawn from the land. This companion hat to the Druid Circle sweater lets you practice your stranded colorwork! Already knit the sweater? You can use your leftover yarn!

\subsection*{Sizing}

Fits preemie (0mo, 6mo, 12mo) \textbf{(child/adult S, adult M, adult L)} heads with options for either a close-fitting beanie or slouchy hat. 
Sizes correspond to head circumferences of 12 (14, 16, 18) \textbf{(20, 22, 24)} in or 30 (35, 40, 45) \textbf{(50, 55, 60)} cm.
Larger sizes can be obtained by following the modification instructions.

% sample measurements, gauge, notes on ease, etc.
\subsection*{Gauge}

6 sts x 8 rows = 1"/2.5cm or 24 sts x 32 rows = 4"/10cm in stockinette with size A needles and MC, after gentle blocking.

\subsection*{Yarn Requirements}

% yardage, number of colors, etc.

% also include: sample yarn, other yarn suggestions
Sport or DK weight yarn in a main color (MC) and two contrasting colors (CC1 and CC2)

\textbf{MC:} 60 (70, 100, 130) \textbf{(170, 200, 250)} yds

\textbf{CC1:} 15 (20, 25, 25) \textbf{(30, 30, 35)} yds

\textbf{CC2:} 20 (25, 30, 30) \textbf{(35, 35, 40)} yds

\vfill
\columnbreak
\subsection*{Tools}

\begin{itemize} % NEEDLES
\item 16" circular needle in \textbf{Size A} needed to obtain gauge, for main fabric. \emph{Suggested: US 4/3.5mm} 
\item DPN's in \textbf{Size A} for crown decreases.
\item 16" circular needle in \textbf{Size B} one size smaller than A, for ribbing.
\item tapestry needle
\item stitch markers % MARKERS
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Techniques}

This pattern is suitable for an advanced beginner with some familiarity with stranded colorwork.
Prior to knitting this pattern, you should be comfortable with knitting in the round, increasing \& decreasing, and simple stranded colorwork. Colorwork is charted only, with no floats longer than 5 stitches. 

~\\
Some support is provided for modifying hat for slouchiness.
Pattern Key describes all abbreviations and describes stitches used.

% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
\section*{Cast On and Ribbing}

With Size B needles and MC, CO 60 (70, 80, 90) \textbf{(110, 120, 130)} sts with a stretchy cast on. Pm for BOR and join in the round. Work 1x1 twisted ribbing for 0.5 (1, 1, 1) \textbf{(1, 1.5, 1.5)}" or 2.5 (2.5, 2.5, 2.5) \textbf{(2.5, 3.75, 3.75)} cm.

\section*{Main Body}

Change to Size A needles and k one round. 

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection*{Increases \emph{(slouchy only)}}

Work Increase Round once, then k one round.

\textbf{Increase Round:} \repeat{K 6 (7, 8, 9) (11, 12, 13) sts, m1} to end of round. \increase{10}

\begin{frnote}
\vocab{Adult S, M, and L only:} Work Increase Round once more, k one round.
\end{frnote}

Upon completing the slouchy increases, you should have 70 (80, 90, 100) \textbf{(130, 140, 150)} sts total. Proceed to colorwork.

\subsection*{Colorwork}

Join CC1 and CC2. Work chart rows 5-25 (5-25, 1-25, 1-25) \textbf{(1-31, 1-31, 1-31)} repeating a total of 7 (8, 9, 10) \textbf{(13, 14, 15)} times around.

\section*{Crown Decreases}

\subsection*{Option A: 10-Point Spiral}

\rowDir{Set Up Round} sm, \repeat{k 7 (8, 9, 10) (13, 14, 15) sts, pm} 9 times, k to end of round. This divides the round into 10 equal sections.

\rowDir{Round 1} \repeat{sm, k to 2 sts from marker, k2tog} to end of round. \decrease{10}

\rowDir{Round 2} k all sts.

Work Rounds 1 and 2 a total of 5 (6, 7, 8) \textbf{(11, 12, 13)} times. You will have 20 sts left, or 2 stitches per section.

\rowDir{Next Rnd} sm, \repeat{k2tog, rm} to end of round.

\subsection*{Option B: 5-Point Star}

\rowDir{Set Up Round} sm, \repeat{k 14 (16, 18, 20) (26, 28, 30) sts, pm} 4 times, k to end of round. This divides the round into 5 equal sections.

\rowDir{Round 1} \repeat{sm, k2tog, k to 2 sts from marker, ssk} to end of round. \decrease{10}

\rowDir{Round 2} k all sts.

Work Rounds 1 and 2 a total of 5 (6, 7, 8) \textbf{(11, 12, 13)} times. You will have 20 sts left, or 4 sts per section.

\rowDir{Next Rnd} sm, \repeat{k2tog, ssk, rm} to end of round. 

\section*{Last Round and Finishing}

Both methods of crown decreases end with 10 sts total. Remove BOR marker, then work k2tog 5 more times to end with 5 sts. 

Break yarn, leaving a 6-8" or 15-20cm tail. Using a tapestry needle, thread yarn through all remaining sts and pull tight to close off hat. Weave in all ends and lightly block if desired.

\section*{Modification Suggestions}

\subsection*{Custom Sizing Guide}

\emph{\small This guide assumes that you are using the gauge specified by the pattern. For suggestions on how to use a different gauge, see the next section.}

Measure the \textbf{head circumference} at the widest point: \hfill [\#1] \underline{\hspace{5em}}

Subtract 1-2" / 2.5-5cm from \#1 depending on desired amount of negative ease in the brim. Multiply this measurement by the stitch gauge, 6 sts (divide by 2.5 if you are using cm). Round to the nearest \emph{multiple of 10} to obtain the \textbf{CO st count}: \hspace{\fill}[\#2] \underline{\hspace{4em} sts}

Measure the desired \textbf{height}, from the base of the ear to the center of the crown:\hspace{\fill} [\#3] \underline{\hspace{3em}}

Divide \#1 by $6.28$ or $2\pi$ to obtain the \textbf{radius}:\\ \hfill [\#4] \underline{\hspace{5em}}

Then, subtract \#4 from \#3 to obtain the \textbf{pre-decrease height} (i.e. when to begin crown decreases): \hfill [\#5] \underline{\hspace{5em}}

~\\
CO in MC and work ribbing to desired length. If desired, work plain st st to add height or increase evenly by 10's for slouch. Work colorwork chart, then work st st until work is at the height calculated for \#5. Choose a crown decrease method and divide stitches into either 5 or 10 equal sections with stitch markers. Work crown decreases as written.

\subsection*{Substituting Gauge}

If you are looking to knit the pattern at a different gauge, you can follow the custom sizing guide mostly as it's written, changing the calculations for \#2 and \#4. Carefully measure both your stitch gauge and row gauge. If the ratio of stitches to rows is not 3:4, the colorwork and decreases may be distorted.

~\\
When calculating the CO st count (\#2), multiply by your stitch gauge instead of 6. Calculate \#4 by dividing your final stitch count by 5, then by your row gauge. Subtract this length from \#3 to obtain \#5.\end{multicols}
